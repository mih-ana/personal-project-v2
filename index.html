                    <em>Jack of all trades,
                        <br />

                <h4>Where I am</h4>
                <p>
                    At the present moment, I am a student at the <abbr title="Seavus Education and Development Center">SEDC</abbr> Academy for Web Development, Generation 2018/2019. The reasons that motivated me to embark upon this programming journey
                    are several. Firstly, taking into consideration the fast pace with which technology has been moving in the past decades, the art of Web Development has grown &mdash; both in popularity, as well as in appeal. Consequently, the demand
                    for trained programming professionals has drastically increased, providing opportunities for persons who are enthusiastic about reinforcing their knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being an passionate learner myself, the art of Web Development has inspired me &mdash; and still maintains the same effect &mdash; to delve deeper into its specifics. Dedicating six months' time grasping the main concepts of the craft through online courses
                    and tutorials, I made the decision of enrolling to the SEDC Academy in order to obtain a deeper insight into the intricacies of Web Programming. The current website provides an overview of the concepts I have mastered during my studies.

                <h4>Where I have been</h4>
                <p>
                    In the distant year of 2010, the Department of English Language and Literature &mdash; at the Faculty of Philology Blaze Koneski in Skopje &mdash; accepted the application of enrollment submitted by yours truly. Having completed all academic work by 2014,
                    my graduation was followed by an application for a Master Degree scholarship at the department of Applied Linguistics at the FON University &mdash; which I succeded in attaining. Finally, I became a Master of Applied Linguistics in
                    June 2017.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the course of both my undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as afterwards, I have been working in translation, interpreting, and writing &mdash; including literary translation, technical translation, conference interpreting, as well as content
                    writing. Interestingly, my meeting with programming topics in the translations I worked on was what drove me to take a peek into the field of Web Programming, and in turn, captivated me. It was exactly this which led me to the point
                    of where I currently am.
